I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Medical Artificial Intelligence Center, the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received the Ph.D. degree in optical engineering from the Sun Yat-sen University in 2024. My research interests include computer vision, hyperspectral image processing, medical image processing, inverse problem and computational imaging.

#SYSU Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
